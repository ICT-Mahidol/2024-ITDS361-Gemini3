|**Use Case Name: transformÂ Science Plan to Observing Program**|**ID:UC002**|**Importance Level:** High|
| :- | :- | :- |
|**Primary Actor:** Science Observer|**Use Case Type:** User-driven||
|<p>**Stakeholders and Interests:**</p><p>**Science Observer:** Needs to accurately transform a Science Plan into an Observing Program to ensure correct execution</p><p>**Astronomer:** Depends on the transformation process to ensure the proposed observations are correctly scheduled</p><p>**Telescope Operator:** Uses the Observing Program to control the telescope and execute the observations</p><p>**Observatory System:** Stores and processes the transformed Observing Program for scheduling and execution</p>|||
|**Brief Description:** This use case describes how a **Science Observer** takes an approved **Science Plan** and transforms it into an **Observing Program**, ensuring it is correctly formatted and contains all necessary parameters for execution by the observatory system|||
|<p>**Trigger:**</p><p>**Science Plan** is approved and submitted to the system.</p><p>**Type:** User-Initiated</p>|||
|<p>**Relationships:**</p><p>`    `**Association:** Science Observer**    </p><p>`    `**Include: -**</p><p>`    `**Extend: -**</p><p>`    `**Generalization: -**</p>|||
|<p>**Normal Flow of Events:**</p><p>1. The Science Observer retrieves an approved Science Plan from the system</p><p>2. The system provides the necessary observation parameters</p><p>3. The Science Observer verifies and adjusts observation parameters if needed</p><p>4. The Science Observer converts the Science Plan into an Observing Program format</p><p>5. The system validates the transformed Observing Program for completeness and correctness</p><p>6. If validation is successful, the Science Observer submits the Observing Program to the system</p>|||
|<p>**Subflows:**</p><p>- If the Science Plan contains errors or missing information, the Science Observer requests corrections</p><p>- The Science Observer may consult with the Astronomer to clarify scientific objectives</p>|||
|<p><a name="_gjdgxs"></a>Alternate/Exceptional Flow:</p><p>- If the system detects missing data in the Observing Program, it notifies the Science Observer for revision</p><p>- If there is a technical issue with system validation, the Science Observer reports it to system support</p>|||
